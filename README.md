# 421-Lab-Notes

Here is where you can see the lab notes for Econometrics, EC421 for Spring 2019. I'll periodically update these after class on Thursdays.

Some Useful Resources:

- A nice collection of resources for those starting out in R.

[Tidyr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-import.pdf) 
- A few of the most useful pages you can find.
