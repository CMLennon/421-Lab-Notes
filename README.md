# 421-Lab-Notes

Here is where you can see the lab notes for Econometrics, EC421 for Spring 2019. I'll periodically update these after class on Thursdays.

Some Useful Resources:

[Ed's Winter Course Github Page](https://github.com/edrubin/EC421W19)

[Getting Started With R](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#r-programming) 
- A nice collection of resources for those starting out in R.

[Tidyr cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-import.pdf) 
- A few of the most useful pages you can find.

[ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
- Another few of the most useful pages you can find, ggplot this time

*Note: I made an error in these notes regarding Goldfeld Quandt degrees of frredom. Look in the notes for a correction*  

**Lab 4**: [Heteroskedasticity](https://github.com/CMLennon/421-Lab-Notes/blob/master/Lab-4/Lab4Notes.md), Alternatively, [link 2](http://rpubs.com/Clennon/Lab4)
- Retrieving errors from your models, Testing for heteroscedasticity in R, graphing errors, using heteroskedasticity robust standard errors.

**Lab 5**: [Homework Help: Problem Set 2](https://github.com/CMLennon/421-Lab-Notes/blob/master/Lab5/Lab5Notes.md), Alternatively, [link 2](http://rpubs.com/Clennon/Lab5)
- Reviewing tests for heteroskedasticity, retrieving errors, and using heteroskedasticity robust errors in an LM model (FELM)

**Lab 6**: [Functions and introduction to time series data](https://github.com/CMLennon/421-Lab-Notes/blob/master/Lab6/Lab6Notes.md), Alternatively, [link 2](http://rpubs.com/Clennon/Lab6)
 - Generating simulated data, functions, sapply, for loops, a tiny bit of time series (including bonus prediction method at end)

**Lab 7**: Time series

**Lab 8**: TBD

A note: I owe a great debt of gratitude to John Morehouse, Alex Li, and of course Ed Rubin for laying the foundations of the lab work for me to build notes off of.

An aside:

If you're adventurous, Grant McDermott's data science for economists is an amazing resource. It's designed for PhD students, but not those with any experience with computers. If metrics is your calling, you might enjoy looking at these.
